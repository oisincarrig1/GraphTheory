# GraphTheoryProject2023

For this project I was asked to research and document the Graph Isomorphic Problem.After completeing this project I have learned a lot about this topic. Having the freedom to do my own research on this project made it challenging but also helped me undertand this issue more.

# Jupyter Notebooks

Before starting this module I had never used Jupyter Notebooks before. Learning about how they work was useful and I now see them as a good way to document a project using code and also text.
